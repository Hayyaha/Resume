    <h1>Cancellation and Refund Policy</h1>
    
    <h3>Digital Products & Services</h3>
    <p>Since [Your Business Name] offers non-tangible, irrevocable digital goods and services (such as Resume Writing or Design), we generally do not issue refunds once the order is accomplished and the product is sent. As a customer, you are responsible for understanding this upon purchasing any item at our site.</p>

    <h3>Exceptions</h3>
    <p>However, we realize that exceptional circumstances can take place with regard to the character of the product we supply. We DO honor requests for the refund on the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Non-delivery of the product:</strong> Due to some mailing issues or technical problems, if you do not receive your delivery, please contact us.</li>
        <li><strong>Major defects:</strong> Although all the products are thoroughly tested before release, unexpected errors may occur.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Contact Support</h3>
    <p>If you believe you are eligible for a refund, please contact us at <strong>[Your Email Address]</strong> or call us at <strong>[Your Phone Number]</strong>.</p>
